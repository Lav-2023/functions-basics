# Functions Basics

In JavaScript, parameters are the items listed between the parentheses () in the function declaration. Function arguments are the actual values we decide to pass to the function.

By calling function inside of console.log() with the argument we get the return value of the function, printed to the console. We’re passing in a function call as an argument in a different function call - log().

If we just called the function without using console.log to print it’s return value, nothing would appear in the console.

     This is an assignment from the Odin Project.

     Write each function and test the output with console.log.

     1. Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7.

     2. Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.

     3. Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.

     4. Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
        lastLetter("abcd") should return "d"
